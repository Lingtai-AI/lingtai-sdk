# lingtai_kernel

> **Maintenance:** see the `lingtai-kernel-anatomy` skill. **Coding agents** update this file in the same commit as code changes. **LingTai agents** report drift as issues (mail or `discussions/<name>-patch.md`); do not silently fix.

The minimal agent runtime: turn loop, lifecycle, signal consumption, tool dispatch, intrinsic wiring, mailbox glue, soul/molt orchestration. The kernel is standalone — the wrapper package `lingtai` (at `src/lingtai/`) depends on it strictly one-directionally.

> **What is an `ANATOMY.md`?** See the canonical convention at `src/lingtai/intrinsic_skills/lingtai-kernel-anatomy/SKILL.md`. This file follows the same 6-section template as every other anatomy in the tree.

## Components

The kernel root holds the coordinator (`base_agent/`) plus a flat collection of supporting modules. Most are self-contained leaves; subfolders are concept-boundary units with their own anatomy.

- `base_agent/` — `BaseAgent`, the kernel coordinator (package of 6 modules). `__init__.py` defines `BaseAgent` (~1027 lines: constructor, properties, state machine, hooks, cross-cutting stubs including the `.notification/` sync trio, pass-throughs to submodules). Submodules: `lifecycle.py` (start/stop/heartbeat/signals/refresh — heartbeat tick now also calls `_sync_notifications`), `turn.py` (main loop/message dispatch/AED/response processing), `tools.py` (tool schemas/dispatch/registry), `identity.py` (naming/manifest/status), `prompt.py` (system prompt building/flushing), `messaging.py` (mail/notification producers/outbound). Soul-flow domain logic lives in `intrinsics/soul/flow.py`. See `base_agent/ANATOMY.md`.
- `notifications.py` — **canonical `.notification/` filesystem helpers** (`fadbabf`/`dda7d8a`). `validate_channel_name()` / guard registry (`notifications.py:37-68`) validate generic-dismiss channel names and let Category-A producers guard unsafe clears. `notification_fingerprint(workdir)` (`notifications.py:71-89`) returns the `(name, mtime_ns, size)` triple-tuple used to detect change between heartbeat ticks. `collect_notifications(workdir)` (`notifications.py:92-113`) reads every `.notification/*.json` into a dict keyed by stem. `publish(workdir, tool_name, payload)` (`notifications.py:116-131`) writes one file atomically (tmp+rename). `clear(workdir, tool_name)` (`notifications.py:134-145`) deletes one file (idempotent). `clear_with_result()` / `dismiss_channel()` (`notifications.py:148-265`) are the strict agent-facing generic dismiss path. `submit(workdir, tool_name, *, data, header, icon, priority, instructions=None)` is the canonical producer-facing helper — wraps `publish` with the standard envelope. The `system` intrinsic re-exports `submit` as `publish_notification` and `clear` as `clear_notification`.
- `session.py` — `SessionManager`. LLM session lifecycle, token bookkeeping, chat history persistence, AED (auto-error-recovery) retry path. Accepts a `notification_inject_fn` callback (wired to `BaseAgent._inject_notification_meta` at construction); called after `_health_check` in `send()` so ACTIVE-state notification meta is prepended to the latest string-content `ToolResultBlock` before the API call goes out.
- `tool_executor.py` — `ToolExecutor`. Synchronous tool dispatch, reasoning-parameter injection, timing, error capture.
- `tool_timing.py` — small helper for tool execution timing records.
- `tc_inbox.py` — `TCInbox` and `InvoluntaryToolCall`. **Legacy queue retained but dormant** under the `.notification/` redesign. Phase 3 will remove this module entirely; meanwhile the producer pipeline writes filesystem files instead of enqueuing. The molt path still calls `agent._tc_inbox.drain()` defensively to clear any pre-redesign items that survived a process restart.
- `prompt.py` — `SystemPromptManager` plus `build_system_prompt` / `build_system_prompt_batches`. Composes the system prompt from identity, capabilities, intrinsics, pad, rules. Default render order (`prompt.py:46-61`): principle → covenant → tools → **substrate** → procedures → comment, then rules → brief → library → codex → identity → pad. `substrate` sits **right after** `tools` so it functions as the long-form companion to the schemas above it (operational wisdom that spans tools — tool tiers, life states, channel discipline, etc.). The kernel ships `lingtai/prompts/substrate.md` as the packaged default (v1, issue #39); the `Agent` subclass auto-seeds `system/substrate.md` from it on first boot — no init.json opt-in required.
- `meta_block.py` — meta-block rendering (the structured prefix the kernel injects into LLM messages with state, time, stamina, etc.).
- `message.py` — `_make_message`, message-type sentinels (`MSG_REQUEST`, `MSG_TC_WAKE`). The wire format for the agent's inbox queue.
- `state.py` — `AgentState` enum (ACTIVE / IDLE / STUCK / ASLEEP / SUSPENDED).
- `config.py` — `AgentConfig` dataclass. Constructor-time options (stamina, soul cadences, max RPM, etc.).
- `workdir.py` — `WorkingDir`. Filesystem layout under the agent's working directory; manifest read/write; git operations.
- `handshake.py` — agent-discovery primitives (`is_agent`, `is_alive`) used by the TUI/portal to scan `.lingtai/` directories.
- `token_counter.py` — token counting helper (used for diary-cue cap, system prompt sizing).
- `token_ledger.py` — append-only per-call token usage log (`logs/token_ledger.jsonl`).
- `time_veil.py` — coarse-time rendering for state-aware prompts.
- `loop_guard.py` — guard against infinite tool loops.
- `logging.py` — logger configuration (separate from the `services/logging.py` event-log service).
- `llm_utils.py` — small shared helpers used by adapter implementations.
- `types.py` — shared type aliases.

## Connections

- **Kernel must never import from the wrapper.** `lingtai_kernel` is standalone; `lingtai` (the wrapper at `src/lingtai/`) depends on it strictly one-directionally.
- The kernel exposes its public surface through `__init__.py`. Anything not re-exported there is implementation detail.
- The wrapper layer registers LLM adapters into `llm.service` at import time, registers capabilities into `Agent` (which subclasses `BaseAgent`), and provides MCP, FileIO, Vision, Search, and the CLI.

## Notifications — the `.notification/` filesystem-as-protocol

Out-of-band events — mail arrival, soul-flow firings, daemon emanations, MCP webhook events, kernel-internal alerts — surface in the agent's wire chat as **a single synthetic `(ToolCallBlock, ToolResultBlock)` pair** of shape `system(action="notification")` whose result is the JSON-serialized union of all currently-active producer files. The LLM has no native concept of "the world poked the agent," so the kernel masquerades the external state as a tool the agent appears to have called.

```
assistant: tool_call(id=notif_…, name="system", args={action:"notification"})
user:      tool_result(id=notif_…, synthesized=True, content="""{
             "_synthesized": true,
             "notifications": {
               "email":  { "header": "3 unread emails", "icon": "📧", ... },
               "soul":   { "header": "soul flow",       "icon": "🌊", ... },
               "system": { "header": "2 system notifications", "icon": "🔔",
                           "data": { "events": [...] } }
             }
           }""")
```

The shape comes from `BaseAgent._inject_notification_pair` (`base_agent/__init__.py:879`). The `_synthesized: True` envelope marker (also written as the `synthesized=True` flag on the `ToolResultBlock`) lets the agent distinguish kernel-injected reads from voluntary `system(action="notification")` calls when reading conversation history.

### Filesystem layout

Producers write a JSON file per channel into `<workdir>/.notification/`:

| File | Owner | Naming convention |
|---|---|---|
| `email.json` | `intrinsics/email` (unread digest, `_rerender_unread_digest`) | bare intrinsic name |
| `soul.json` | `intrinsics/soul/flow.py` (consultation fire) | bare intrinsic name |
| `system.json` | `base_agent/messaging.py:_enqueue_system_notification` (events list, max 20 newest) | bare intrinsic name |
| `mcp.<server>.json` | external MCP server adapter (e.g. `mcp.imap.json`, `mcp.telegram.json`) | dotted prefix |

Each file is the producer's complete state for that channel — there is no "queue of unread events." When the producer's state empties (e.g. unread count drops to 0), it deletes the file. The basename (without `.json`) becomes the dict key the agent sees in `notifications`.

### Single-slot wire invariant

At most ONE `system(action="notification")` pair lives in the wire history at any time. When the kernel detects a fingerprint change, it strips the prior pair (recording its `call_id` in `agent._notification_block_id`) and either reinjects a fresh pair or — if all producer files vanished — leaves the wire empty. Agents observe the **current** notification state, not a history of arrivals. Past arrivals belong in the producer's own logs (e.g. `mailbox/inbox/`, `logs/soul_flow.jsonl`), not in the wire.

### Producer contract — `submit(workdir, tool_name, *, data, header, icon, priority, instructions=None)`

In-process producers call **`publish_notification`** (re-exported by the `system` intrinsic from `notifications.submit`) — the canonical helper that wraps `notifications.publish` with the standard envelope:

```python
from lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.system import publish_notification, clear_notification

publish_notification(
    agent._working_dir, "email",
    header=f"{n} unread email{'s' if n != 1 else ''}",
    icon="📧",
    instructions=(
        "After handling, call email(action=\"read\", email_id=[...]) "
        "or email(action=\"dismiss\", email_id=[...]) to clear "
        "handled mails from this notification."
    ),
    data={"count": n, "newest_received_at": ts, "digest": body},
)

# When state empties:
clear_notification(agent._working_dir, "email")
```

Side effects of `publish_notification`:
- Writes `.notification/<tool_name>.json` atomically (tmp + rename) with `{header, icon, priority, published_at, data}` plus an optional top-level `instructions` field when the producer supplies one.
- Returns immediately — no enqueue, no wake post. The kernel sync mechanism (next section) handles wire injection.

The optional `instructions` field is the producer-side directive — text describing what the agent must do to dismiss or act on the notification. It rides with the payload so each producer owns its own dismissal contract; generic frontend / kernel code does not need to know per-producer rules. Email uses it for "call read or dismiss to clear"; soul flow leaves it unset (voices are advisory, no dismissal needed); MCP servers can carry their own.

**Dismissal contract.** Producers fall into three categories. **Category A — mirror over real producer state** (e.g. `email` over `read.json`) MUST register with `register_generic_dismiss_guard("<channel>", "<suggested verb>")`; generic clearing would leave producer state unchanged and the mirror inaccurate. **Category B — notification IS the output** (e.g. `soul`, `system`) may use generic `system(action="dismiss", channel=...)` or convenience aliases. **Category C — coalesced event summary** (e.g. `mcp.<server>`) may use generic dismiss after the agent has handled the summarized event. New producers declare the category and follow that contract.

External producers (MCP servers over SSH, separate processes) bypass the helper and write the same envelope directly to `<workdir>/.notification/mcp.<server>.json` using `tmp + rename`. The contract is the filesystem layout, not the Python API.

### Sync mechanism — `BaseAgent._sync_notifications`

Three pieces of state on `BaseAgent` (`base_agent/__init__.py:366-372`):
- `_notification_fp: tuple` — last-observed `(name, mtime_ns, size)` triple-tuple from `notification_fingerprint`. Updated only on successful sync.
- `_notification_block_id: str | None` — `call_id` of the currently-injected wire pair, or `None` if no pair is in the wire.
- `_pending_notification_meta: str | None` — JSON body stashed during ACTIVE state for the next `SessionManager.send()` to prepend onto the latest tool result.
- `_pending_notification_fp: tuple | None` — fingerprint tied to the ACTIVE-state stash, committed only after successful injection; reset on empty-state sync or molt.

The sync loop runs from **two trigger points**:
1. **Heartbeat tick** (`base_agent/lifecycle.py:334`) — `agent._sync_notifications()` after `_check_rules_file`. Default cadence is the heartbeat interval (~1s); the producer's `_wake_nap` calls also nudge the heartbeat for sub-second latency.
2. **Voluntary calls** — `system(action="notification")` (`intrinsics/system/__init__.py:97`) returns `collect_notifications(workdir)` directly. Reading is always free; the agent can poll its own notification state any time without touching the wire.

`_sync_notifications` (`base_agent/__init__.py:761`):
1. Compute fingerprint. If unchanged, return (cheap path — the common case).
2. On change, strip the prior wire pair via `interface.remove_pair_by_call_id(prior_block_id)`.
3. If `notifications` is empty, the wire is now clean — clear any pending ACTIVE-state stash, commit the new (empty) fingerprint, and return.
4. Otherwise, dispatch on agent state:
   - **IDLE** — `_inject_notification_pair` splices the synthetic `(ToolCallBlock, ToolResultBlock)` pair (impersonating a voluntary `system(action="notification")` call from the agent's perspective), then posts `MSG_TC_WAKE` and `_wake_nap("notification_sync")`. IDLE is "blocked on `inbox.get()`," so without a wake the loop sits forever and the pair never reaches the LLM. **Wake handler**: `_handle_tc_wake` (post-redesign) drives one inference round off the existing wire via `session.send(None)` — the adapter skips the input-append step and sends the canonical interface as-is. From the LLM's viewpoint the wake is indistinguishable from the agent voluntarily calling `system(action="notification")` and reacting to the result. No fake user message, no meta prefix. (The earlier wake-message draft posted `MSG_REQUEST(content=None)` to drive a meta-only turn through `_handle_request`; that was reverted because the meta line landed visibly in the agent's chat history every time a notification arrived. The "voluntary call" framing is cleaner.)
   - **ACTIVE** — stash the JSON body in `_pending_notification_meta`. The agent's run loop is between request boundaries; injecting a `(call, result)` pair now would race the in-flight tool round. Instead, the SessionManager's `notification_inject_fn` callback prepends `notifications:\n<json>\n\n` onto the latest string-content `ToolResultBlock` at request-send time, after stripping any stale prefix from older blocks. Dict-content `ToolResultBlock`s (MCP structured results) are skipped to preserve their schema.
   - **ASLEEP** — clear `_asleep` and `_cancel_event`, transition `IDLE` (reason `notification_arrival`), `_reset_uptime`, then proceed exactly like the IDLE branch (inject pair + post `MSG_TC_WAKE` → `_handle_tc_wake` drives the wire). This is the canonical notification-driven wake.
   - **STUCK / SUSPENDED** — observe but don't inject. The on-disk state is captured; injection is deferred until state recovers.
5. Commit the new fingerprint **only if injection succeeded** (or the state cannot inject — STUCK/SUSPENDED/empty). If `_inject_notification_pair` returned False because `interface.has_pending_tool_calls()` (mid-pair tail), `_notification_fp` stays at its prior value and the next heartbeat tick retries.

### Why this beats the legacy `tc_inbox` queue

The previous design (queue of `InvoluntaryToolCall` items + pre-request drain hook + per-id dismiss path) carried four pain points:
1. **Stateful queue** — producers had to track whether their event was still queued vs already spliced (the `_dismiss` path branched on this).
2. **Per-arrival pairs** — every event got its own pair. A burst of arrivals during ASLEEP woke the agent N times with N pairs to dismiss.
3. **Two consumers** — `_drain_tc_inbox` was called from `_handle_request`, the pre-request hook, and `_handle_tc_wake`, with subtle ordering and idempotency requirements.
4. **No external-process producers** — only in-process Python could enqueue; MCP servers running over SSH had no path.

The filesystem-as-protocol redesign collapses all four into "write a file, read a fingerprint." Producers are stateless; agents observe current state, not arrival history; the kernel has one consumer (`_sync_notifications`); and any process that can write to the workdir is a valid producer.

### Voluntary `system(action="notification")` — read-your-mailbox path

Beyond kernel-driven sync, agents can call `system(action="notification")` themselves. The handler (`intrinsics/system/__init__.py:97`) returns the bare `collect_notifications(workdir)` dict — no `_synthesized` envelope, since the call wasn't synthesized. Useful when the agent wants to recheck producers without waiting for the next sync tick.

### Migration window — `tc_inbox` is dormant, not deleted

Phase 2 (`d2da97e`) migrated all in-tree producers (mail, system events, soul flow) to `publish_notification`. Phase 2.5 migrated the LICC MCP inbox (`core/mcp/inbox.py`) to publish via `notifications.submit` to `.notification/mcp.<server>.json` instead of posting to the legacy inbox queue. The `tc_inbox.py` module survives as dead code — no producer enqueues, the drain hook is still installed but always finds the queue empty. Phase 3 (deferred to a separate point release after soak) will:
- Delete `tc_inbox.py`.
- Remove the pre-request drain hook from `BaseAgent._install_drain_hook` and the three drain call sites.
- Remove the `_dismiss` deprecation no-op (currently still answers `system(action="dismiss")` with `{"status":"ok","note":"...deprecated..."}` for in-flight chat histories).

### Adjacent: healing mid-pair tails

Distinct primitive (and unrelated to notifications) — `interface.close_pending_tool_calls(reason)` (`llm/interface.py:344`) synthesizes `tool_result` placeholders for orphan tool_calls when the wire chat itself ends mid-pair (process killed mid-turn, snapshot saved mid-turn). Marks them `synthesized=True`; if a real result arrives later for the same id, `add_tool_results` overwrites the placeholder so the wire stays honest. Used in `base_agent/turn.py:317-321, 418-422, 450-454, 891-895` after sleep/retry/continuation exceptions, and at snapshot save time in `intrinsics/psyche/_snapshots.py`. The notification path repurposes the same `synthesized=True` flag, but the two systems don't share code.

### Known issue: ACTIVE meta injection invalidates strict-prefix caches

`_inject_notification_meta` (`base_agent/__init__.py:1126`) prepends `notifications:\n<json>\n\n` onto the most recent `ToolResultBlock.content` (line ~1213), and **also strips stale notification prefixes from every other `ToolResultBlock` in user entries** (lines ~1199-1209). The strip-step edits content at byte positions earlier than the new tail target, so a strict-prefix automatic cache (any backend whose cache is a single lookup over the full input from byte 0) invalidates everything from the earliest edited block forward.

Impact observed on the codex preset (`gpt-5.5` via ChatGPT Codex Responses API, strict-prefix automatic cache): ~10% of LLM calls land in the 0-10% cache-rate bucket and correlate tightly with `notification_stashed_active` + `notification_meta_injected` event sequences in `events.jsonl`. Two example incidents from `~/work/lingtai-dev/.lingtai/codex-gpt5.5/logs/token_ledger.jsonl`:

- `2026-05-11T07:07:25Z` — 178k input, 0 cached after 4× `notification_stashed_active sources=['molt']`.
- `2026-05-11T07:27:52Z` — 161k input, 0 cached after 6× `notification_stashed_active sources=['email']`.

Anthropic / MiniMax workloads are unaffected — the kernel emits explicit `cache_control: ephemeral` breakpoints on the system prompt and tools schema (`lingtai/llm/anthropic/adapter.py:75, 92, 130`); tool-result history lives past the last breakpoint, so the strip-step doesn't invalidate the cached portion. DeepSeek / MiMo workloads appear unaffected on current load patterns — their backends' cache windows absorb the impact at the byte level — but the same workload type with shorter histories or different shard routing could surface the same symptom.

Fix shapes (none currently scheduled):
- **Append-only injection**: stop modifying existing `ToolResultBlock.content`; append notifications as a new tail message. Cleanest for cache, changes wire shape and substrate guidance.
- **Single-pointer tracking**: keep prefix-on-tool_result semantics but track which block currently bears the prefix; mutate at most 2 blocks per injection (the prior pointer + the new target) instead of walking every user entry. Reduces edit count from N to 1-2; doesn't eliminate mid-prefix edits when the prior pointer is back in history.
- **Lazy strip**: prepend on the new tail only; never strip old prefixes. Single edit per injection. Wire ends up with multiple "live-looking" notification prefixes — substrate would need to teach the agent that only the most recent is current.

The current implementation is intentional for non-strict-prefix backends; this note exists so future readers don't rediscover the codex-specific cost without context. Don't fix until the codex case is load-bearing.

## Composition

This file is the top of the kernel anatomy tree. Each subfolder below has its own `ANATOMY.md` — descend into the one that holds your question.

- [`base_agent/`](base_agent/ANATOMY.md) — `BaseAgent` class (the kernel coordinator). 7 submodules: identity, lifecycle, turn, soul_flow, tools, prompt, messaging.
- [`intrinsics/`](intrinsics/ANATOMY.md) — kernel-built-in tools. Four intrinsics: `system`, `psyche`, `soul`, `email`. Always present, never removable.
- [`llm/`](llm/ANATOMY.md) — LLM service ABC, adapter registry, chat interface, streaming protocol. Provider adapters live in the wrapper package, not here.
- [`services/`](services/ANATOMY.md) — kernel-side service implementations: filesystem mailbox (`mail.py`), JSONL event log (`logging.py`).
- [`migrate/`](migrate/ANATOMY.md) — versioned, append-only migrations for kernel-managed on-disk state. Each migration is `m<NNN>_<name>.py`.
- [`i18n/`](i18n/ANATOMY.md) — three-locale message catalog (en / zh / wen). Loaded by `t(language, key)` in the intrinsics.

## State

The kernel only writes inside the agent's working directory (`<workdir>/`). Per-folder anatomy files name the specific files each subsystem writes; this root only catalogs the top-level layout:

- `history/chat_history.jsonl` — wire history (one line per role+content entry).
- `history/snapshots/` — periodic git-tracked snapshots.
- `system/` — kernel-managed durable state (pad, soul records, summaries, rules).
- `logs/events.jsonl` — structured event log (the JSONL service).
- `logs/token_ledger.jsonl` — per-call token usage.
- `mailbox/{inbox,outbox,sent}/` — filesystem mailbox.
- `.notification/<tool>.json` — notification dropbox (one file per producer channel — `email.json`, `soul.json`, `system.json`, `mcp.<server>.json`). Polled by `BaseAgent._sync_notifications` on every heartbeat tick. See "Notifications" section above.
- `.agent.json`, `.agent.heartbeat`, `.status.json` — manifest, liveness signal, runtime snapshot.
- Signal files (`.prompt`, `.inquiry`, `.sleep`, `.suspend`, `.clear`, `.rules`) — consumed by `base_agent/lifecycle.py` heartbeat ticks.

## Notes

- **The anatomy tree is being populated.** Every existing subfolder anatomy is listed in Composition; deeper anatomies will appear as agents do work in those folders. When you do work in a folder that lacks one, write it before leaving — see the convention skill for the writing checklist.
